                <h2>
                    The past and present of federal laws regarding technology
                </h2>
                    <p>
                        The federal government has been regulating technology practically since the formation of the 
                        United States. The constitution lays out the requirement for the process of obtaining patents for
                        inventions. There has been a lot that has changed since those days regarding technology. We will 
                        provide examples of the past, as well as examples for the present.
                    </p>
                <h3>The Digital Tellecomunications Act (1996)</h3>
                    <p>
                        Signed into law by President Clinton, this law would essentially allow the modern internet 
                        to take shape. The main purpose of this law was to break up monopolies from cable companies and 
                        phone companies. One major provision of this act was section 230, which stated “No provider or user 
                        of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information 
                        provided by another information content provider.” This provision allowed for the growth of social
                        media, as platforms could not be sued for anything someone says on the platform.
                    </p>
                <h3>National Artificial Intelligence Initiative Act (2020)</h3>
                    <p>
                        Signed into law by President Trump in 2020, this law established the National AI Initiative Office,
                        a regulatory agency designed to oversee artificial intelligence. Unlike the Digital Tellecomunications
                        Act, this act does not establish or remove regulations. This law is essentially stating how the
                        government should approach artificial intelligence. We have likely not seen the full effect of this
                        law yet, and there will likely be more important laws passed regarding how the federal government
                        will handle AI.
